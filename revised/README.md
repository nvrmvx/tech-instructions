## **1. Install iTunes on your computer**
**If you are using Mac**: skip this step as iTunes is already installed on your device by default.
<br>
**If you are using Windows**: [install the latest version of iTunes](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/itunes/9pb2mz1zmb1s "Install iTunes") as you see on the screenshots:

<br>
<br>
That button will take you to the Microsoft Store:

<br>
<br>
Wait for the download to finish, proceed with the installation by accepting terms & conditions and clicking "Continue" when prompted.
<br>
<br>

## **2. Choose the audio file for your ringtone**
iTunes **does not** let us make files longer than 40 seconds into ringtones.
<br>
**If you already have an \*.m4r file that is shorter than 40 seconds** you may skip steps 2 and 3.
<br>
**Otherwise** you should use an [online audio trimmer](https://audiotrimmer.com "Online Audio Trimmer").
<br>
To upload your file click on the `Browse..` button and select your file from the explorer:
<br>

<br>
<br>
Wait for the upload progress bar to finish and proceed to the next step:

<br>
<br>

## **3. Trim the audio and obtain the \*.m4r file**
Move the sliders on the left and right to select the part of the audio that you want for your ringtone. You may also use the `+` and `-` buttons next to `Start` and `End` to make your cut more precise (Remember that the resulting length has to be shorter than 40 seconds):
<br>

**Select `m4r` from the dropdown menu next to `Output Format`** and click `Crop >>`:

<br>

## **4. Connect your phone to the computer**
Open the iTunes app on the computer and using the charging cable connect your iPhone to the computer.

## **5. Upload the file to your phone**
In iTunes, click on the icon that appeared when you connected your smartphone:
<br>

<br>
<br>
Select `Tones` from the `On My Device` menu on the left side of the window:
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Drag and drop your cropped audio file from the explorer to `Tones`:

<br>
<br>
After the file is uploaded you may disconnect your phone from the computer.
<br>
<br>

## **6. Select your new ringtone in the settings**
On your iPhone go to the `Settings` > `Sounds & Haptics` > `Ringtone` and select your audio file from the ringtones list.
