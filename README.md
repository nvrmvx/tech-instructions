# How to Add Your Own Ringtone on an iPhone?
## You will need:
* Computer with Internet access
* The song that you want to be your ringtone

## Steps:
### **1. Install iTunes on your computer**
**If you are using Mac**: skip this step as iTunes is already installed on your device by default.
<br>
**If you are using Windows**: [install the latest version of iTunes](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/itunes/9pb2mz1zmb1s "Install iTunes") as you see on the screenshots:

Wait for the download to finish, proceed with the installation by accepting terms & conditions and clicking "Continue" when prompted.
### **2. Choose the file for your ringtone**
iTunes **does not** let us make files longer than 40 seconds into ringtones. If your audio file is longer than 40 seconds you could use an [online audio trimmer](https://audiotrimmer.com "Online Audio Trimmer"). To upload your file click on the `Browse..` button and select your file from the explorer:

### **3. Trim the file to be shorter than 40 seconds**
Move the sliders on the left and right to select the part of the audio that you want for your ringtone. You may also use the `+` and `-` buttons next to `Start` and `End` to make your cut more precise.
